# Introduction

## Overview

To make use of this documentation effectively, you should possess a general understanding of programming basics. The programming languages used throughout are mainly Rust, Solidity, and JavaScript, for which previous knowledge is not necessary but would be highly beneficial. In conjunction with improving your understanding of the material contained within these guides, we recommend that you review supplemental material covering these languages in order to improve your overall understanding of the topics and practical code examples provided.

#### Do I need blockchain knowledge to follow this documentation?[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/Introduction/#do-i-need-blockchain-knowledge-to-follow-this-documentation) <a href="#do-i-need-blockchain-knowledge-to-follow-this-documentation" id="do-i-need-blockchain-knowledge-to-follow-this-documentation"></a>

Your blockchain knowledge will be useful, but if you are reading this, that means you are on the right track.

#### I'm a Polkadot builder. Do I need this?[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/Introduction/#im-a-polkadot-builder-do-i-need-this) <a href="#im-a-polkadot-builder-do-i-need-this" id="im-a-polkadot-builder-do-i-need-this"></a>

If you are already a builder on the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, you can most likely skip the Introduction chapter. But it is recommended that you read about available networks.

#### Do I need to be a developer to understand the Introduction chapter?[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/Introduction/#do-i-need-to-be-a-developer-to-understand-introduction-chapter) <a href="#do-i-need-to-be-a-developer-to-understand-introduction-chapter" id="do-i-need-to-be-a-developer-to-understand-introduction-chapter"></a>

To use this introduction chapter, you do not need any programming skills, and it will be useful later when you step into more advanced topics.
