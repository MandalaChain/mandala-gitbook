# Mandala Chain Networks

The Mandala Chain Networks are designed to provide a robust and flexible blockchain infrastructure, supporting both test and main network environments. This documentation outlines the key components and configurations of the Mandala Chain Networks.

***

### Testnets

Testnets are essential for developers and testers to experiment with new features and applications without affecting the main network. They provide a safe environment to test upgrades, smart contracts, and other blockchain functionalities.

#### Niskala

Niskala is the designated testnet for the Mandala Chain. It serves as a sandbox environment where developers can deploy and test their applications. Key features of the Niskala testnet include:

* **Free Transactions:** Transactions on Niskala are free, allowing developers to test without incurring costs.
* **Frequent Resets:** The network is periodically reset to ensure a clean testing environment and to incorporate the latest updates.
* **Realistic Conditions:** Niskala mimics the conditions of the mainnet, providing a realistic testing ground for applications.

To connect to the Niskala testnet, use the following RPC endpoint in [here](../../niskala-testnet/)&#x20;

### Mainnets

Mainnets are the live networks where real transactions occur, and they hold actual value. The Mandala Chain mainnet is designed for high performance, security, and scalability.

#### Mandala Chain

* The Mandala Chain is the primary mainnet, offering a secure and efficient blockchain platform for various applications.&#x20;
* The functionality will be equal to the Niskala testnet, with a focus on the proven security and stability that have been battle-tested on the Niskala testnet.
