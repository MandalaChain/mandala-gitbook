# Test Tokens (Faucets)

A faucet is the site/place where you can get testnet tokens. Faucets are available for the Niskala testnet accounts in the form of KPGT. Use them to make sure your wallet has enough assets to cover the cost of deployment and pay transaction gas.

## What is the KPGT faucet for?

Tokens on Mandala Chain Testnets like Niskala do not have any real-world value besides **experimenting** with the features on the network.

## How to get KPGT faucet?
