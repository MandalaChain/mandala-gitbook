# Network RPC endpoints

## What is RPC Node?[â€‹](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/environment/endpoints#what-is-rpc-node) <a href="#what-is-rpc-node" id="what-is-rpc-node"></a>

* RPC nodes can be queried for information and used to initiate transactions.
* The purpose of RPC nodes is to allow decentralized applications and clients to communicate with a Blockchain network.
* RPC nodes listen for requests, respond with the necessary data, or execute the requested transaction.
* Common usage of RPC nodes includes querying the Blockchain for information, sending transactions, and executing smart contract functions.
* RPC nodes are important for decentralized applications to function and interact with a Blockchain network, allowing for decentralized exchange and other use cases.

## Public Endpoints <a href="#public-endpoints" id="public-endpoints"></a>

> INFO
>
> The free endpoints below are dedicated to end users, they can be used to interact with dApps or deploy/call smart contracts.
>
> They limit the rate of API calls, so they are not suitable for high demand, such as a dApp UI constantly scraping blockchain data or an indexer.

> TIP
>
> To meet the demands of a production dApp, we provide you with our integration layer called Dhatu. Please refer to [Dhatu](../integration-layer.md) documentation for more details.
