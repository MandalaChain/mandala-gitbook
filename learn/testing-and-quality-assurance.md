# Testing and Quality Assurance

## Introduction

### Purpose

This Quality Assurance (QA) documentation outlines the QA strategy, processes, and procedures for ensuring the quality of the Mandala Chain project. This document serves as a reference for the project's QA team, development team, and stakeholders involved.

### Scope

This document covers the quality assurance activities related to the development, testing, and documentation of the Mandala Chain project. It outlines the QA approach, test plan, defect management, and documentation requirements.

### Definition, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

* QA: Quality Assurance
* Substrate: A blockchain development framework.
* Blockchain: A decentralized and distributed digital ledger.
* QA: Quality Assurance
* API: Application Programming Interface

## QA Strategy

### QA Objectives

The QA objectives for this project are to:

* Ensure the reliability, security, and performance of Mandala Chain.
* Identify and mitigate defects before deployment.
* Verify compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.
* Provide accurate and comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

### QA Approach

The QA approach will involve a combination of manual and automated testing methodologies. Test coverage will include _unit testing_, _integration testing_, _system testing_, _performance testing,_ and _security testing_.

### Testing Types

* **Unit Testing:** Verify the correctness of individual components and modules.
* **Integration Testing:** Validate the interactions between different components.
* **System Testing:** Validate the entire system's behavior and functionality.
* **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the system's performance under different loads.
* **Security Testing:** Identify vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

### Test Environment

* **Development Environment (Devnet):** Used for individual module testing.
* **Staging Environment (Private Testnet):** Used for integration and system testing.
* **Production Environment (Public Testnet):** Used for final testing before production (Mainnet) deployment.

## Test Plan

#### Test Scope

The test scope includes testing the following aspects:

* Smart contracts and transaction processing.
* Pallets and Runtime.
* Consensus mechanisms.
* Data storage and retrieval.
* Network connectivity and communication.
* User interfaces and API endpoints.

#### Test Schedule

The testing activities will be conducted in parallel with development phases, as follows:

* Unit testing: Throughout development.
* Integration testing: After individual modules are developed.
* System testing: Before staging environment deployment.
* Performance testing: Before production deployment.

#### Test Entry and Exit Criteria

* **Test Entry Criteria:** Code is available for testing, unit tests are passing, and documentation is updated.
* **Test Exit Criteria:** All high-priority defects are resolved, test cases have been executed successfully, and performance meets predefined thresholds.

#### Test Deliverables

* Test plans, test cases, and test scripts.
* Test execution reports and defect reports.

#### Test Resources

* QA team: Testers responsible for planning, executing, and reporting tests.
* Development team: Provide support during testing phases.

#### Test Cases

Test cases will be documented for each testing type, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

#### Test Execution

* Test cases will be executed according to the test plan.
* Defects will be logged and tracked for resolution.

## Defect Management

#### Defect Reporting

* Defects will be reported using a standardized defect report template.
* Precise information on defect description, severity, steps to reproduce, and environment details will be provided.

#### Defect Classification

Defects will be classified based on _**severity**_ (_critical_, _major_, _minor_) and _**priority**_ (_high_, _medium_, _low_).

#### Defect Tracking and Resolution

* Defects will be tracked using a defect-tracking system.
* Defect resolution will involve analysis, fixing, testing, and verification.

## Documentation

#### User Documentation

* User guides explaining how to use the blockchain application and its features.
* API documentation for developers integrating with the blockchain.

#### Technical Documentation

* Detailed technical specifications of the blockchain's architecture and components.
* Smart contract documentation.
* Deployment instructions for different environments.

#### Process Documentation

QA process documentation outlining testing methodologies, processes, and procedures.

## QA Sign-Off

QA sign-off will be granted when all testing phases are successfully completed and exit criteria are met.
