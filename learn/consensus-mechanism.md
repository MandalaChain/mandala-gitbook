# Consensus Mechanism

## The PoA Launch[â€‹](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-launch#the-poa-launch) <a href="#the-poa-launch" id="the-poa-launch"></a>

The Genesis block of the Niskala Testnet will be launched in Q4 2023 as a Proof of Authority (PoA) network. Whereas the Madya Mainnet launch could be expected around Q2 2024. Governance will be restricted to the Sudo (super-user) keys held by the Mandala Foundation to issue the commands and upgrades necessary to complete the launch process.&#x20;

During this time, validators started joining the network and signalling their intention to participate in the consensus. In this phase, the Mandala Chain operates as a Proof of Authority (PoA) chain maintained by validators belonging to the Mandala Chain Foundation. The chain only allowed users to claim KPG tokens or submit their intention to validate.
