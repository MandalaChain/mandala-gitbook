The project will leverage zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) technology to enable private transactions and verification without compromising privacy - creating a trustless, secure, private data storage and transfer environment. Mandala Chain is a solution to the problem of data privacy and security, offering secure and private data storage and transfer in the blockchain ecosystem. ZKP feature will be implemented in the near future when it reaches the adequate level of maturity for Substrate implementation. Stay tuned for our future updates.

### KEPENG Coin

Kepeng Coin (Ticker: $KPG) is a cryptocurrency used for governance, gas fees, and node development in the Mandala Chain ecosystem. It is inspired by a traditional Balinese coin called Kepeng, which has cultural and spiritual significance and is still used in Balinese villages for governance and offerings. Kepeng Coin aims to honor this tradition by incorporating it into the Mandala Chain ecosystem to incentivize users to contribute to the network's growth and development. Kepeng Coin will serve as a governance token, allowing holders to participate in network decisions, and as a means of payment for transaction fees on the network.
