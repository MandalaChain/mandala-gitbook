## Mandala Chain Layer 1 Networks[â€‹](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-guide#polkadot-ecosystem-networks) <a href="#polkadot-ecosystem-networks" id="polkadot-ecosystem-networks"></a>

### **Mandala** network (Mainnet):&#x20;

* Mandala is the main network that acquires features after they are established and stable on the Niskala testnet.&#x20;
* The functionality will be equal to the Niskala testnet, with a focus on the proven security and stability that have been battle-tested on the Niskala testnet.

### **Niskala** Test network (Testnet): &#x20;

* Niskala is a value-bearing test network that gets features before Mandala does.&#x20;
* Functionality is equal to the future Mandala mainnet, with possible next-generation testing of features from time to time that will eventually migrate onto Mandala Mainnet.
