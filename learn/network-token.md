# Network Token

In the Mandala Chain network, the native token of Madya Mandala is Kepeng Token, with the ticker KPG, whereas the testnet token of Niskala testnet is KPGT. Both KPG and KPGT tokens have 18 decimals.

### Utility[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/astar-tokens#utility) <a href="#utility" id="utility"></a>

The Kepeng Token (KPG) is the utility token for Madya Network and has two primary functions.

1. Transactions
2. On-chain Governance

#### Transactions[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/astar-tokens#transactions) <a href="#transactions" id="transactions"></a>

Every on-chain transaction requires the sender to pay fees. Part of the fee is burned, and part is deposited to the treasury.

#### On-chain Governance[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/astar-tokens#on-chain-governance) <a href="#on-chain-governance" id="on-chain-governance"></a>

At Mandala Chain, we believe in the power of decentralized decision-making. That's why we're committed to implementing on-chain governance in the future, where every community member has a voice in shaping the network's future. The Kepeng token plays a crucial role in this process, serving as the primary means for facilitating governance activities such as voting and referenda.

The Kepeng Testnet Token (KPGT) is a utility token for testing the features of the Niskala testnet. More details can be found in the [Faucet ](../build/build-environment/test-tokens-faucets.md)section.
