## Polkadot JS App

### Polkadot{.js} Browser Plugin[​](https://docs.astar.network/docs/use/Manage%20wallets/create-wallet#recommend-polkadotjs-browser-plugin) <a href="#recommend-polkadotjs-browser-plugin" id="recommend-polkadotjs-browser-plugin"></a>

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use Polkadot {.js} with Niskala:

The browser plugin is available for both [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en) (and Chromium-based browsers like Brave) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension). After installing the plugin, you should see the orange and white Polkadot{.js} logo in your browser menu bar.&#x20;

### Create Account

Click the big plus button - "Create new account." The Polkadot{.js} plugin will then use system randomness to make a new seed for you and display it to you in the form of twelve words.

You need to back up these words. Please store the seed somewhere safe and secure. If you cannot access your account via Polkadot{.js} for some reason, you can re-enter your seed through the "Add account menu" by selecting "Import account from pre-existing seed".

It is best to create an account that is allowed on _any chain_ in the Mandala Chain ecosystem. This account can then be used for Niskala. Your account will automatically change format when connected to a chain.

A **descriptive name** is arbitrary and for your use only. It is not stored on the blockchain and will not be visible to other users who look at your address via a block explorer. If you're juggling multiple accounts, it helps to make this as descriptive and detailed as needed.

The **password** will be used to encrypt this account's information. You will need to re-enter it when using the account for any outgoing transaction or to cryptographically sign a message.

> DANGER
>
> Note that this password does **NOT** protect your _**seed phrase**_. If someone knows the twelve words in your mnemonic seed, they still have control over your account even if they do not know the password.

After clicking on "Add the account with the generated seed", your account is created. We recommend also saving your account as a JSON file somewhere safe.
