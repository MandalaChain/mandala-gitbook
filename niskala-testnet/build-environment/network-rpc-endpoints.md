# Network RPC endpoints

## What is RPC Node?[â€‹](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/environment/endpoints#what-is-rpc-node) <a href="#what-is-rpc-node" id="what-is-rpc-node"></a>

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints are crucial components in blockchain networks, allowing users and applications to interact with the blockchain. This document provides an overview of RPC nodes in the Niskala network, detailing public endpoints and their intended use cases.

An RPC node is a server that allows clients to communicate with a blockchain network using the Remote Procedure Call protocol. It acts as an intermediary between the client (such as a decentralized application or dApp) and the blockchain, enabling users to send transactions, query data, and interact with smart contracts.

In the context of the Niskala network, RPC nodes facilitate seamless interaction with the blockchain, providing developers and users with the necessary tools to build and utilize decentralized applications.

## Public Endpoints <a href="#public-endpoints" id="public-endpoints"></a>

Niskala offers several public RPC endpoints that are accessible to users and developers. These endpoints are designed to facilitate interaction with the blockchain for various purposes, including deploying and calling smart contracts, as well as querying blockchain data.

> INFO
>
> The free endpoints below are dedicated to end users, they can be used to interact with dApps or deploy/call smart contracts.
>
> They limit the rate of API calls, so they are not suitable for high demand, such as a dApp UI constantly scraping blockchain data or an indexer.
